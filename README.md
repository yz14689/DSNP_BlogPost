## Data source
Bostone_AirBnB data (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston)

## Purpose:
This analysis is to find the most imp ortant features of Boston's AirBnB market upon the given period. It could help either the visitor or the potential host to make correct decision. Basically, it will look into the data and answer where, when and what are the best target if any vacation or investment is in plan.

## Questions to be answered:

2. When to visit:  Timing: Does season or event really matter? Does the price echo the demanding?
3. What to expect: Is the cost of stay associated with rating/room/etc? How to save some money?

## Analysis Steps:
1. Load and clean the data
2. Merge all three datasets and dig with questions
3. Visualize for 
   location (strat by average rating, demanding, room type), - heatmap
   demanding (strat by time, location, rating) 
   Plot price (strat by location, demanding, room type, discount) - histgram  
3. Conclusion from results: For different needs, suggest the best place to stay/invest.
4. Write the blog following: Introduction, 3 questions (with hgihlighted title), conclusion/echo/action.

##  Next Challenge:
1. Compared to other popular cities in different area to see if any common features
2. For investment, estimate the return in each city and find the best option
